          <h2>Summary</h2>
        </heading>
        <p>I have been living in Seattle for around 5 years now. Recently I worked at a company as and SDET where I did manual testing and some automation for many projects that the company developed. I know many popular business practices like agile developement, scrum, test driven development, and I am familiar with the concepts behind XP programming. Currently I am transitioning from a QA role to a Developer role by taking classes at Codefellows to help round out my skills.</p>
